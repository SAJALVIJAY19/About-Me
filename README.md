# 👋 Hey there! I’m Sajal Vijayvargiya

🎓 **B.Tech CSE (Data Science & Analytics)**  
🧑‍💻 **Future Software Engineer | Data Analyst | Data Engineer | Business Analyst**

I enjoy turning **messy data into clean insights**, **ideas into working systems**, and **coffee into code ☕**.  
Somewhere between debugging errors and optimizing SQL queries, I discovered I love building things that actually *work in the real world*.

## 🚀 What I’m Busy With These Days

- 🧠 Wrestling with **DSA (Python)** — some days I win, some days it wins  
- 🏗️ Building **real-world projects** (not just “Hello World” ones)
- 📊 Making data tell stories using **Power BI & Python**
- ☁️ Learning how software behaves *after* it leaves my laptop
- 🧾 Preparing different avatars of my resume (SDE, DA, DE, BA)

## 🧰 My Tech Toolbox

### 🧑‍💻 Coding & Core CS
- **Python**, SQL, Bash  
- Data Structures & Algorithms (Python)
- DBMS fundamentals (yes, normalization too 😅)

### 📊 Data & Analytics
- EDA (finding patterns before models do)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Power BI (Dashboards that actually answer questions)
- Excel (advanced enough to scare people)

### 🤖 Machine Learning
- Supervised & Unsupervised ML
- Model evaluation & feature selection
- Scikit-learn & statistical modeling
- End-to-end ML pipelines (from raw CSVs to predictions)

### 🏗️ Software & Data Engineering
- Backend APIs (FastAPI – learning by building)
- PostgreSQL
- Data pipelines & warehousing (foundations)
- Docker (containers > “works on my machine”)

### 🛠️ Tools I Live In
- Git & GitHub
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code
- Google Colab
- Power BI

### 🌐 Languages I Speak
- English – Fluent  
- German – Conversational (on a steady journey 🇩🇪)

## 💡 What I Bring to the Table

- 🧠 **Problem Solver** – Breaks big problems into smaller, solvable ones  
- 🔍 **Analytical Thinker** – Asks *why* before writing code  
- 🗣️ **Clear Communicator** – Can explain tech without causing headaches  
- 🧩 **System Thinker** – Loves seeing how pieces fit together  
- 🤝 **Team Player** – Works well with humans (and machines)  
- 📈 **Lifelong Learner** – Curiosity > comfort zone

## 🧭 My Journey So Far (and Ahead)

### ✅ 2025 — The Foundation Year
- Built strong fundamentals in **DSA, SQL, and CS basics**
- Created multiple **Analytics, ML, and Engineering projects**
- Learned what “real-world data” actually looks like (spoiler: it’s messy)
- Finally figured out where I fit best: **SDE + Data roles**

---

### 🚀 2026 — The Execution Year
- 💼 Land a **full-time role or high-impact internship**
- 🏗️ Build **production-style projects** (APIs, pipelines, dashboards, ML)
- ☁️ Get hands-on with:
  - AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda, Redshift basics)
  - Docker (real usage, not just commands)
  - Kubernetes 
- 🧠 Be interview-ready in:
  - DSA (Python)
  - Advanced SQL
  - Junior-level System Design

---

### 🌍 2027 — The Big Picture
- 🇩🇪 Prepare for **international opportunities (Germany focus)**
- 📈 Grow into a strong **individual contributor**
- 🧑‍💻 Work on **large-scale systems that people actually use**
- 🎯 Step into **mid-level engineering / analytics responsibilities**
